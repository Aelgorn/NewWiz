/*
* A script to animate the player's movement.
* Use left, right, up, and down arrow keys to move the player around (please note that any lefties can also use the classic WASD).
* Note: The player animator is getting updated by this script and is displaying temp animations to indicate the player direction.
* Note2: Directions can be combined; i.e. you can go diagonally up-left and the animation will be specific to that key combination. I thought
* I'd get that implementation out of the way now, in case we decide to use it. All we need to do if we do want to use it is replace the
* animations contained in the states. Just drag 'em on in there.
